the tag "p" refers to "paragraph" and is how trash magic knows to put things in a blue box

paragraphs start with <p> and end with </p>

<p>
what is your story? how did you get here?  who are you?  who are you here to connect with?  
</p>

<p>
    what art do you make?  what creations do you want to share? 
</p>

<p>
    what waste streams are you most interested in?  what waste streams do you work with?  what do you wish you could make out of trash if you had all the resources in the world to support your efforts?
</p>

<P>where can you be found? where can people meet up with you to pick up or drop off stuff and share information and media?  how can people reach you?</P>
